# TurbaFlow -  Fence against human turbulence.

## Domain: Urban Management
## Problem Statement: To effeciently manage the huge crowd at events such as religious gatherings in Mecca, Kumbh, Shirdi and Tirupati.

## Proposed Solution:

Considering the scale ratio of individual human with respect to the complete crowd and the dynamics of the crowd, the scenario can be considered equivalent to a fluid dynamics model wherein each human is acting as a molecule of the fluid with some restricted volume around it, hence giving rise to virtual cohesive and adhesive forces. A turbulence in this module can be considered as a sudden fluctuation caused in the streamline flow of the fluid, thus giving rise to random motion of the molecules. Similarily the case can be considered for stampede, where a sudden disturbance in the movement of the crowd may cause panic and abrupt motion amongst the people creating a hazard to life and property. Following this equivalence with fluid dynamics, the dynamics of the crowd can be estimated and consequently the turbulent vulnerable points can be detected. These turbulent points can be controlled by providing suitable diversions, by physically equiping traffic control volunteers and roadblocks.

## Methodology

* The traffic management unit can be equiped with a designated web-based portal for analysis and control of the expected crowd.
* Based on previously collected data
  * The number of people arriving for the event can be estimated
  * The hotspots in the premises of the event can be judged.
  * The density variation of the crowd with respect to time and the day can be estimated 
* These estimations can be trained in accordance with fluid dynamics to predict the turbulent vulnerable points.
* Furthermore drones can be deployed to capture livefeed of the crowd to detect dense clusters following X-Means algorithm. These clusters would facilitate dynamic analysis of the crowd thus supporting dynamic points.
* The portal would provide the basic layout of the premises to facilitate the analysis of the crowd with respect to the collected data, thus generating contour maps with respect to density and velocity over the geographical map.
* The detected vulnerable points can be resolved by releasing the developed stress in the form of outlets as physical traffic road blocks and diversions.
 
 ## Possible extensions 
 
* Apart from religious getherings. it can be used to manage variety of crowds in varied events such as
  * Funfairs for students
  * Concerts for energetic crowd.
  * Yoga gatherings 
* The proposed solution can also be extended to vehicular traffic management with roadways analogous to pipelines and vehicles corresponding to varied size molecules in a heterogeneous fluid solution.
